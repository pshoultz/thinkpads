[x330 mod notes]
	power button = brightness levels, this was part of the x330 mod
	NOTE: display is weird and wacky in terms of DPI and scale.  I made a reddit post and someone mentioned to me how the configs should look.  Copy those if system needs to be restarted.
		--the username for the reddit was was n0tatest

[system programs that do things]
	pulsemixer = replaces pavucontrol
	alsamixer = volume control
	nm-applet = wifi/ethernet control
		--nm-applet also has nmcli and nmtui as alternate ways to access networkmanager

[TODO]
	hook in dunst commands for notificatoins in the system
	nerdfont form github was downloading, apply those later
	try to get icons to work in terminal
	make i3bar look better
	symlink and all the importat files for the x330 machine and push them to github so I don't lose them when or if I need to reinstall
