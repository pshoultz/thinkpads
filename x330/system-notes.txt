[x330 mod notes]
	power button = brightness levels, this was part of the x330 mod
	NOTE: display is weird and wacky in terms of DPI and scale.  I made a reddit post and someone mentioned to me how the configs should look.  Copy those if system needs to be restarted.

[system programs that do things]
	pulsemixer = replace pavucontrol.  pavucontrol is buggy, the GUI takes forever to load
	alsamixer = volume control
	nm-applet = wifi/ethernet control
